# Smart cooling and hazard detection system

This project implements an integrated smart cooling and hazard detection system using environmental sensors and actuators for automated responses, enhancing safety and comfort in monitored spaces.

System Components:

1.	Sensors:
   
o	HC-SR501 PIR Motion Sensor: Detects motion within 6 meters and a 110° x 70° field of view, triggered by infrared radiation.
o	DHT22: Measures ambient temperature and humidity.
o	MQ-135 Gas Sensor: Detects harmful gases like CO, methane, and LPG (200-10,000 ppm).

2.	Actuators:
   
o	12V DC Fan: Adjusts cooling speed based on user-defined temperature.
o	OLED Display: Shows real-time temperature, fan speed, and alerts.
o	LEDs: Indicates system status (green for normal, red for hazards).
o	Buzzer: Sounds alarms in hazardous conditions.
o	Precision Microdrives LRA (C10-100): Provides haptic feedback, controlled via Adafruit DRV2605L.

3.	Power and Connectivity:
   
o	Powered by a 12V DC source regulated via an LM2596 buck converter for 5V operation.
o	Internet-enabled via a SIM800L module for remote monitoring.
o	Fan powered separately with soft-start circuitry to prevent inrush current spikes.

Control Logic:

1.	Cooling System:
   
o	A rotary potentiometer allows the user to set the desired temperature (mapped from analog input to 0–40°C).
o	A PID controller ensures stable operation by adjusting the fan speed to maintain the set temperature.

Proportional adjusts speed based on current error.
Integral addresses accumulated error.
Derivative predicts future errors.

o	PWM signals generated by the Arduino Mega control the fan via an IRLZ44N MOSFET with a 1N4007 flyback diode to suppress voltage spikes.

2.	Hazard Detection:
   
o	The MQ-135 continuously monitors air quality.

o	If harmful gases or temperatures exceed safe limits, a red LED activates, "GAS DETECTED" displays, and the buzzer sounds an alert.

3.	User Feedback:
   
o	The DRV2605L drives haptic feedback patterns: short pulses for significant deviations and smooth ramping vibrations when nearing the target temperature.

Operational Workflow:

•	The PIR sensor detects motion, triggering the DHT22 to measure temperature and humidity.

•	Based on readings, the PID controller adjusts the fan speed to maintain user-defined conditions.

•	Hazardous conditions, such as excessive heat or dangerous gases, activate visual (LEDs), auditory (buzzer), and tactile (LRA) alerts.

Power Management:

•	Capacitors (0.1 µF ceramic, 10 µF electrolytic) stabilize the DRV2605L.

•	The fan employs a soft-start mechanism to minimize power surges.

This system delivers intelligent environmental control, blending advanced monitoring, real-time feedback, and precise actuation for optimal functionality in home or industrial setups.
